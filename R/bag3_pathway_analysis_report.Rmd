*This is an in-depth analysis based on one or more initial broad analyses.*

The goal of this analysis is to explore the functional role of [BAG3 (BCL2 Associated Athanogene 3)](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=BAG3).

Datasets used in this analysis include:

- [github.com/eturkes/bag3-co-ip](https://github.com/eturkes/bag3-co-ip): Co-IP MS (co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry) data using BAG3 as bait.

This analysis was performed in R except where noted.
The source code and instructions for rerunning the analysis can be found at [github.com/eturkes/bag3-pathway-analysis](https://github.com/eturkes/bag3-pathway-analysis).

# Final Results

**Read just the following sub-section for the final results of the analysis and a brief summary of the methods.**

# ~~~ Breakdown of Methods ~~~ {-}

**Sections from here to the end break down the methods used and are optional to read.**

We start by loading in any required packages and setting some global variables.

```{r}
packages <- c("conflicted", "magrittr", "DT", "data.table", "plyr")
invisible(suppressPackageStartupMessages(lapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE)))

assets_dir <- file.path(getwd(), "..", "assets")
results_dir <- file.path(getwd(), "..", "results")

# Adds download buttons and exponential values.
datatable_custom <- function(dt) {
  datatable(
    dt,
    extensions = "Buttons", options = list(dom = "Blfrtip", buttons = list(
      "copy", "print",
      list(extend = "collection", buttons = c("csv", "excel", "pdf"), text = "Download")),
    rowCallback = JS(
      "function(row, data) {for (i = 1; i < data.length; i++) {if (data[i]>1000 | data[i]<1) {",
        "$('td:eq('+i+')', row).html(data[i].toExponential(2));",
      "}}}")))}
```

# Original Data

The following subsection(s) provide a brief overview of the datasets used in this analysis.

## BAG3 Co-IP MS {.tabset}

Source: [github.com/eturkes/bag3-co-ip](https://github.com/eturkes/bag3-co-ip)

The final Co-IP MS dataset after cleaning as described in the reportâ€™s method section.
Briefly, the original dataset was subject to missing value imputation via a custom method, the abundance ratio was scaled to a range of 0-100, and changes between scr and shBAG3 conditions were hypothesis tested using the beta-binomial method.
Additional validation was performed using Watson for Drug Discovery, which looks for literature and chemical relationships among entities.
Two sort schemes are presented, one to show specificity with BAG3 and another to show the most abundant Co-IP proteins.
Ideally, the two schemes would be combined to show which proteins interacted most highly with BAG3, but this is nontrivial to do accurately considering experimental limitations.

```{r}
co_ip_genes <- readRDS(file.path(assets_dir, "bag3-co-ip", "co_ip_genes.rds"))
co_ip_cols <- c(
  "Gene", "BAG3 Specificity", "Scaled Abundance Ratio", "Watson Specificity Confidence",
  "Watson BAG3 Similarity", "scrRNA Abundance", "shBAG3 Abundance")
```

### Specificity with BAG3

```{r}
co_ip_genes_spec <- co_ip_genes[order(-co_ip_genes[[co_ip_cols[2]]], co_ip_genes[[co_ip_cols[7]]]), ]
rownames(co_ip_genes_spec) <- NULL # Reset row numbers.
datatable_custom(co_ip_genes_spec) %>%
  formatRound(c(2, 3, 4, 5)) %>% formatStyle(co_ip_cols[1], `text-align` = "center")
```

### Abundance of Protein

```{r}
co_ip_genes_abun <- co_ip_genes[order(-co_ip_genes[[co_ip_cols[6]]], -co_ip_genes[[co_ip_cols[7]]]), ]
rownames(co_ip_genes_abun) <- NULL # Reset row numbers.
datatable_custom(co_ip_genes_abun) %>%
  formatRound(c(2, 3, 4, 5)) %>% formatStyle(co_ip_cols[1], `text-align` = "center")
```

# g:Profiler

We start by taking our gene lists and inputing them into [g:Profiler](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/gost), a web service for functional enrichment analysis [@raudvere_g:profiler:_2019].
g:Profiler is the first step in a 2019 Nature Protocols paper on pathway analysis [@reimand_pathway_2019] that we will generally be following for this analysis.
While an official R client was trialed for this section, it was found to have various deficiencies, so we opt to use the web GUI.
Fortunately, reproducibility is granted through an auto-query feature, where a web URL is generated that leads to the original request.
These URLs are included here and are also useful for interactive exploration.

Two figures are provided in each subsection:

- A Manhattan plot which shows the relative enrichment of various data source terms.
By visiting the web app, one can click the circles and generate a table comparing the terms between the two gene lists.
- A table breaking down data source terms, their p-values, and genes determined to be associated with each term.

## BAG3 Co-IP MS {.tabset}

Since we have two gene lists from this set that are nontrivial to combine, we shall continue analyzing them in parallel.
Below are the parameters used for each list, documentation for which can be found [here](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler/page/docs).

```
version = 96_eg43_p13_563554d
organism = rnorvegicus
all results = false
ordered = true
no iea = true
sources = GO:MF, GO:CC, GO:BP, KEGG, REAC
combined = false # true in Manhattan plot.
numeric ns = ENTREZGENE_ACC
domain scope = annotated
measure underrepresentation = false
significance threshold method = g_SCS
user threshold = 0.05
no evidences = false
```

It should also be noted that the following queries contain genes that are considered ambiguous by g:Profiler and must be manually resolved and has been done for the following figures.
These resolutions are not recorded with the auto-query feature, so must be done again when visiting the interactive link.

The following resolutions were performed:

```
BAG5 -> ENSRNOG00000011527
HIST1H4B -> ENSRNOG00000050933
MYH9 -> ENSRNOG00000004860
RPL12 -> ENSRNOG00000028993
RPS27A -> ENSRNOG00000004426
```

# Watson for Drug Discovery

IBM's [Watson for Drug Discovery](https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-drug-discovery) (WDD) is a text-mining platform that has built a massive corpus of scientific insights drawn from publications and other data forms.
Various insights based on co-occurrence in literature can be obtained with and without input lists of data, which can take the form of various entities (genes, drugs, diseases, etc).
It should be noted that WDD does not take into account list order, so sort schemes will not matter.
WDD also lacks an API, so this section was done manually rather than programmatically.

WDD has several distinct tools, which are summarized here:

- Explore a Network: A visualization of entities that co-occur with the input entities.

## BAG3 Overview

First, we use WDD's tools to get an overview of BAG3 without the addition of any datasets.

### Explore a Network {.tabset}

Each tab visualizes the co-occurance of the named entity with BAG3.

![](../assets/watson/network/overview-chemicals.png)

### Co-occurrence {.tabset}

Each tab provides a table of the co-occurance of the named entity with BAG3.
Tables are primary sorted by p-value and secondary sorted by Documents with BAG3.

```{r}
co_occur_cols <- c("Entity", "Total Documents", "Documents with BAG3", "p-value")

# Function for renaming and subsetting columns and sorting rows.
import_co_occur <- function(file, cols) {
  co_occur <- fread(file.path(assets_dir, "watson", "co-occurrence", file))
  co_occur <- rename(co_occur, c(
    "Entity name" = cols[1], "Documents" = cols[2],
    "(Documents) BAG3" = cols[3], "(Affinity) BAG3" = cols[4]))
  co_occur <- co_occur[order(co_occur[[cols[4]]], -co_occur[[cols[3]]]), ]
  co_occur <- co_occur[ , cols, with = FALSE]}
```

#### Genes

```{r}
co_occur <- import_co_occur("overview-genes.csv", co_occur_cols)
datatable_custom(co_occur) %>%
  formatStyle(co_occur_cols[1], `text-align` = "center")

# Visualization

Cytoscape [@shannon_cytoscape:_2003] is an open-source platform for visualization of networks with an extensive collection of third-party apps.
Together with the apps Enrichment Map [@merico_enrichment_2010] and AutoAnnotate [@kucera_autoannotate:_2016], results from g:Profiler, GSEA, and more can be visualized in an intuitive way.
Although APIs exist to carry out this process programmatically, it is unwieldy considering that networks must be manually adjusted in almost all cases, so at least for the time being we opt to use the Cytoscape GUI.
Links to figures in [CyNetShare](https://idekerlab.github.io/cy-net-share/) are also provided, which allow for interactive exploration of data with the caveat that there are slight alterations in the layout of nodes and the large clusters from AutoAnnotate cannot be displayed.

## BAG3 Co-IP MS {.tabset}

Starting with this set, we again separate the analysis by the gene list we use.
The following parameters were used for the following set of tabs.

```
Data source = g:Profiler
P-value = 1.0
FDR Q-value = 0.1
Test used = Jaccard Overlap Combined Index (k constant = 0.5)
Jaccard Overlap Combined = 0.375
```

### Specificity vs. Abundance

The following figure shows the difference in enriched pathways when assessing enrichment with both gene lists present.
Based on the number of two-color nodes, we see that while most pathways overlap, some are enriched more highly in one set over the other.
